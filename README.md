# Simple texture replacement mod

## Current support

## Setup

***(This assumes you have the modloader already setup)***

Create A new folder `Managed/Mods/Assets/TMR/Textures`

Inside this folder place any textures you wish to load. **NOTE:** They must be named identically to what they are called ingame. You can get these names either through using tools such as [unityAssetBundleExtactor](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE/releases) or AssetStudio or by contacting me on discord **Archie the inventor#4744**.
